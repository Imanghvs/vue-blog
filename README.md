# Vue Blog

It's a simple blog made with Nuxt3 by a Back-End Developer trying to learn Front-End.

## What it is

It's just a simple blog UI. On the main page you can see a list of posts - currently only 5 posts, later pagination will be added - and each post's body is clamped and if you open a post, you will see the full text along with all the comments.
You may leave a new comment on any post you like and check the result.
Every component has a skeleton for the loading phase.

The layout is very simple and it is open to suggestions.

Also the project is responsive.

## Server & Data

The project uses [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as the server,
but currently just shows the first 5 posts (I should add pagination later).

## Run the project

It's enough to clone the project and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technologies

Nuxt3, pinia and Tailwind CSS are the main technologies in this project
